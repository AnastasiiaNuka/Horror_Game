# Darkroom Survivor


## :scroll: Description 

* Darkroom Survivor is a first-player horror game. Travel through creepy levels of dark rooms, searching for various puzzle keys, while avoiding dangers. Run for your life!

You will be able to move around, pick up and use some items, open and close (when you need to hide) doors. At the same time you should avoid monsters that swarm the rooms and corridors at all costs.

I created this game because I am very passionate about the horror genre of games, using only free assets from the Unity Store. :)
